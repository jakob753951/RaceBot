# RaceBot

Yet another Discord bot i made for a server that i started, but have now transferred ownership of.
        
This one has the cool capability of scraping data from websites in order to check what "license" a user has on the game platform "iRacing".     
It also has Database integration along with storing user-id's from iRacing and connecting them to the user's Discord id,    
so you don't have to remember your customer id, every single time you want to check your licenses.
you can also check the licenses of other users, using their Discord id.
Along with all this, it shows the data in a concise way, with a nice message, to show the user, that it's loading the data beforehand.
